742298797,Operations,"Webb ProjectThe Webb Project is in the north-east of Western Australia in the Aileron province of the West Arunta Orogen (WAO) and has been recognised by the Company, neighbours and Geoscience Australia as being prospective for large magmatic mineral systems such as iron oxide copper gold (IOCG)-style mineralisation, nickel sulphide mineralisation, rare earth elements and niobium. The precursor company to CGNR demonstrated the prospective for diamondiferous kimberlites by discovering the kimberlite field in Australia. During this period a suite of geological and geophysical data were collected and used to refocus the exploration towards large magmatic systems."
